# LibraryManagementSystem-Final

This project is a professional full-stack platform designed for the comprehensive management of modern libraries. The system is built using Spring Boot technology for the backend and utilizes Microsoft SQL Server for secure and reliable data storage. The web pages are dynamic and use Thymeleaf technology to display information in real time to the user.

The software allows for the registration of new books including details such as title, author, and category. The system has an integrated engine to track the book lending process, automatically recording who has borrowed a book and when it is due for return. Additionally, the platform includes a member management system where each user has their own protected profile.

From a technical perspective, the code is organized in a clean and modular way. Hibernate is used to link the code with the database automatically. The project is ready to be deployed on professional servers using Docker, making it easy to install on any device. Security is a priority, which is why database connections and email services are protected through system environment variables.

This version includes all the necessary tools to start working immediately, providing a fast and secure experience for library administrators.
